This mod is pretty much the same as Spdskatr's original, it has only been updated for 1.1.

The changes that were made:
- Mean time between ore detection of the long range scanner in 1.1 is 4 days, guaranteed ore detection time (this seems to be new) is 8 days. With the Scanner efficiency research, these values are reduced to 2 and 4 days. The range increase was not implemented as that particular variable has been removed from the object and I didn't feel like digging through the code to find where it went.
- The ground scanner's behaviour has been changed, it no longer displays all undergound veins, but instead detects them one by one, same as with the long range scanner. It also had the 4 and 8 days default values. The scanner efficiency research also reduces these numbers to 2 and 4.

I have also removed the russian language resources, as the scanner efficiency description has changed and I don't speak russian to be able to update it. It felt safer this way.

Everything else should work the same as with the original mod.
